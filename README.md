# Donut-Database

The project's plan involved creating a database of donuts in MySQL and learning the fundamentals of PHP, thus providing the website the backend profile. Additionally, I built the main operational functionality such as adding, listing, searching, sorting and removing the donuts from the table's data.
The only part that is needed and I am still working on is the connection of the pieces, frontend and backend.
